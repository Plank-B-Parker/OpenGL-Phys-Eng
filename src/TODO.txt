TODO:

Over all:
    Minimise number of classes.

Physics:
    Add basic drag and air resistance.
    Add collisions.
    Add constraints.
    Add fields
        Add fluids.
        Add electro-magnetic fields

Go through rendering pipeline:
    Get ride of stuff like "G11." using static imports and do the same with math classes.
    Make Rendering easy to follow, avoid inheritance where you can, follow physics class example.
    Add the other textures, normals and height maps and what ever.
    Add more functionality by being able to add colour to objects.
    Make it real easy to draw stuff to the screen, and print text on the screen.
    Be able to have other window or something.

Go through object classes:
    Make it readable and call all the methods by easy names.
    Make it more intuitive.
    Figure out why you even have an object handler class.
    Do we even need a loader class(probably, make it nicer if you can).

Input:
    Just add some controls already.

Make code more Java friendly:
    Copy constructors.
    Chill out with the VecPool stuff?
    I donno, maybe just code this in C++ or C#? Just saying...

Logger:
    Give more features and render on screen.

Have analytical shapes:
    They dont have to take a path for mesh. Mesh is generated.
    Moment of inertia and volume analytically calculated.
